## Connecting to GitHub

To manage version control and collaborate on this project, you can connect it to a GitHub repository directly within Firebase Studio.

1.  **Find the Version Control Tab**: In the left-side panel of the Studio interface, look for the "Version Control" icon (it typically looks like a tree branch diagram).
2.  **Connect to GitHub**: Click the icon and select the option to "Connect to GitHub".
3.  **Authenticate**: A GitHub authentication window will open. Authorize Firebase Studio to access your GitHub account.
4.  **Choose or Create a Repository**: After authenticating, you can either create a new repository directly from Studio or connect to an existing empty repository in your account.
5.  **Push the Code**: Once connected, Studio will perform the initial commit and push all the project files to your selected GitHub repository.

After these steps, your project will be linked, and you can commit and push all future changes directly from the Firebase Studio interface.
